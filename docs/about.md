title: About Tridentu 2 Wiki
---
# Intro

Every distro worth its salt has a wiki, right? Well, here's another one. Tridentu 2's wiki is just like Gentoo's in practice - for anyone who uses *or* develops for Tridentu 2 or later.

# Who could use it?

The target audience for Tridentu 2 are those who want a stable distro that isn't based on Debian or Ubuntu. Tridentu 2 is based on LFS. As a result, Flatpak is used
for obtaining most applications.

# Sections

This wiki is divided into several sections. As a result, you will see several different topics under a similar umbrella. Each umbrella has a main page, and the several different subpages. Topics can be one page if they are simple enough.
